            <h1>Hello! I'm Fernandez, Cyrus O.</h1>

            <div class="contents">
                <h4>Student @ Tarlac State University</h4>
                <h4>From: BSIT-TSM, 3A</h4>
                <p> 
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m not good at describing 
                    my self and for me it feels to be biased that’s 
                    why I ask one of my friend to describe me form her perspective, in other 
                    to remove false information since it’s coming from other people <br>
                    
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "Cyrus is a introvert person,
                    he is a kind, a gentleman, and a humble person I know. You are the one who 
                    wish me a "Happy Birthday". He is a person who really really loves rides, 
                    he is adventurous person,  he loves doing codings and more on electronics, 
                    he is also a strong person I ever know. They say having a guy friend is a 
                    waste of time, but for me, having you is a life partner, who will laugh 
                    together with me, wiping my tears, and boost my confident, who will be 
                    so much fun than me, who will be vibing with me and my jokes. We created 
                    so much memories together and hoping there will be next time and soon. 
                    You are the best friend that I treasure more than anything in this world. 
                    I'll keep telling to the universe that "You're my best friend" who stay 
                    by my side through my ups and downs. Hoping this will be last forever!" <B><I>-Luna_ella</I></B>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Courage is more exhilarating than fear and in the long run it is easier.
                        We do not have to become heroes overnight. 
                        Just one step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up, 
                        seeing it is not as dreadful as it appeared, 
                        discovering we have the strength to stare it down.” – Eleanor Roosevelt
